# Explore the environmental coverage and representativeness of sites across climatic gradients

This script uses climatic data from WorldClim and a data frame of permafrost CO2 flux sites with geolocation information. It explores how well these sites cover the climatic gradients within the study domain using maps, scatterplots, bar graphs, histograms and a simple machine learning example.
