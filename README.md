# Explore the environmental coverage and representativeness of sites across climatic gradients

The script in this repository uses climatic data from WorldClim (https://www.worldclim.org/) and a data frame of permafrost CO2 flux sites with geolocation information (https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1692). The study domain is the permafrost region defined by Brown et al. 2002 (https://nsidc.org/data/ggd318). This permafrost file, reprojected to WGS 1984 and dissolved to a single polygon in ArcMap, is found in the data folder.

The aim of the script is to demonstrate using these example files how well sites cover the climatic gradients within the study domain using maps, scatterplots, bar graphs, histograms and a simple machine learning example.
